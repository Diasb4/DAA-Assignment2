# Assignment 2 — Algorithm Analysis: Insertion Sort (Binary)

## Overview
This project implements and analyzes the **Binary Insertion Sort** algorithm with detailed performance tracking.

It includes:
- Source code (`InsertionSort.java`)
- Performance metrics (`PerformanceTracker.java`)
- Empirical results and plots
- Individual analysis report in `docs/analysis-report.pdf`

## Structure
- `src/` — algorithm and metrics code  
- `tests/` — benchmark scripts  
- `data/` — CSV files with runtime statistics  
- `plots/` — generated performance graphs  
- `docs/` — report files  

## How to Run
1. Compile:
   ```bash
   javac -d out src/com/example/**/*.java
